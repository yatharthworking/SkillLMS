# LMSFINAL Local Setup

This repo contains:

- `Frontend-LMS`: React frontend on `http://localhost:3000`
- `Backend-LMS`: Spring Boot backend on `http://localhost:8901/soul`
- PostgreSQL database: expected locally as `lmsdb`

## Bring the stack up

1. Frontend
```bat
cd Frontend-LMS
npm install
npm start
```

2. Backend
```bat
cd Backend-LMS
start-backend-local.cmd
```

3. Database

Create PostgreSQL database `lmsdb` with user `lms` / password `lms123`, then run:

- `Backend-LMS/setup-postgres-local.sql`
- `Backend-LMS/seed-postgres-demo-users.sql`

## Notes

- The frontend falls back to `http://localhost:8901/soul` if `REACT_APP_LMS_BACKEND_BASE_URL` is not set.
- The backend now includes its `application.properties` inside the packaged app.
- Maven wrapper runs are configured to use a writable local user home through `Backend-LMS/.mvn/jvm.config`.
